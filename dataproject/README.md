# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Demographic challenges in France - and in the rest of EU** and is about the demographic challenge especially in France. It deals with the newly passed act of raising the retirement age in France and genrerally the demographic challenge in the EU. 

We fetch data from Eurostat and OECD on pensions expenses, GDP, effective retirement age and old age ratio. Our analysis suggests that there may be valid arguments for increasing France's retirement age, despite of big protests. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the demographic challenge faced by France and the rest of the EU is not diminishing and is expected to continue to grow.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. PAG (*OECD*) 
2. SRP_EXP_PENS (*Eurostat*)
3. NAMA_10_GDP (*Eurostat*)
4. DEMO_PJANIND (*Eurostat*)
5. PROJ_23NDBI (*Eurostat*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install pandas-datareader``

``pip install eurostat``
