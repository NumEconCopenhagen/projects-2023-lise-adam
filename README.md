1. Inaugural project. We explore a model for the division of household work between men and women. We examine what degree of substitutability and difference in household productivity reproduces an empirical result the best. Furthermore, we provide an extension to the model that allowed differences between men and women in their marginal disutility of labor and estimate which parameters fit the empirical result the best.
2. Data project. We fetch data from Eurostat and OECD on pensions expenses, GDP, effective retirement age and old age ratio. Our analysis suggests that there may be valid arguments for increasing France's retirement age, despite of big protests. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the demographic challenge faced by France and the rest of the EU is not diminishing and is expected to continue to grow.
3. Model project. We model a principal agent model, where the probability of high sales depends on the agent's effort. We solve the model analytically and numerically and compare these solutions. Futhermore we illustrate the principal's optimal choice for different parameter values. Lastly, we extend the model with letting the principal choose whether to monitor the agent or not and having to pay a cost if he/she decides to do so. We illustrate how the optimal choice depends on monitoring cost.
