# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**Content:** We explore a model for the division of household work between men and women. We examine what degree of substitutability and difference in household productivity reproduces an empirical result the best. Furthermore, we provide an extension to the model that allowed differences between men and women in their marginal disutility of labor estimate which parameters fit the empirical result the best.
