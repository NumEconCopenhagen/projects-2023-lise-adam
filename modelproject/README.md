# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Should you go partying or not? - A Principal Agent model ** and is about a principal who hires an agent.
The agent can choose to go partying or staying home and his probability of high sales the day after depends on this choice. The principal decides a potentially performance-based wage contract and should decide what wages are optimal. 
We solve the model analytically and numerically and compare these solutions. Futhermore we illustrate the principal's optimal choice for different parameter values.
Lastly, we extend the model with letting the principal choose whether to monitor the agent or not and having to pay a cost if he/she decides to do so. We illustrate how the optimal choice depends on monitoring cost. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
